# Reinforcement Learning Project : Maze 

Here's our repository dedicated to Reinforcement Learning. A small project will be conducted and used as a course project at ENSTA Paris.


We implemented two Reinforcement Learning methods that revolves around the Q-learning algorihm and used them to exit a maze. Those two methods are the epsilon-greedy and the Boltzmann exploration.


You'll find here several folders :

/Include is for the headers

/data is for the data input

/src is for the algorithms and the environnements by themselves.

/build is a folder created during the make to stock .o and .x files


Operation instructions : 
make
cd build/
./main
